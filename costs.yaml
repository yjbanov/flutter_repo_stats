# Cost is measured in SWE hours.

# Productivity loss due to infra complexity, fragility, and missing eng prod
# features.
#
# Sources of cost:
#
#   * Flakiness
#   * Lack of downstream testing
#   * Lack of framework-engine integration functional testing
#   * Lack of framework golden testing on engine commits
#   * Lack of "Google Testing" in the engine
#   * Lack of flake detection in the engine
#   * Lack of unified dependency management
#   * Cost of having to maintain the additional infra complexity
#   * Cost of repeated effort to bring up identical infra per repo
infraComplexity: 1.0 # SWE hours per commit

# Productivity loss when making a change that touches multiple repos.
#
# Sources of cost:
#
#   * Technical debt (e.g. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/141734)
#   * Multi-PR "dance" to land one change (e.g. https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/141734#issuecomment-2141054607)
#   * Roll latency
#   * Context switch from lack of atomicity
#   * Multi-repo reverts
#   * Multi-repo bisection
#
# The cost is estimated by looking at how often cross-layer changes are made in
# the framework and assuming a similar ratio of changes that cross the engine
# and the framework.
crossRepoOverhead: 8.0 # SWE hours per commit

# Opportunity cost from siloed development.
#
# Due to the high barrier of cross repo development, a significant portion of
# the team chooses to stay in the comfort zone of working with one repo. This
# prevents the team from tackling the more difficult but more impactful issues
# that require full stack changes in the system.
siloedDevelopment: 1.0 # SWE hours per commit

# Cost of a manual engine roll.
#
# Includes SWE hours spent by people directly involved in the manual roll,
# likely more than one, and cost of the latency introduced to the rest of the
# team.
#
# When an engine roll fails to auto-roll, it typically means that the automatic
# roll was manually cancelled, or reverted, likely by a person different from
# the author of the breaking change (e.g. the engine sherriff). The author of
# the engine change had to take over, and get it over the finish line without
# the auto-roller's assistance. This also likely means that the autoroller was
# stopped an unable to roll other engine changes, increasing the latency for all
# upstream repos.
manualEngineRoll: 24.0 # SWE hours lost to a single manual roll

# Cost of an engine revert.
#
# Includes SWE hours spent by people directly involved in the revert, and the
# cost of the latency introduced to the rest of the team.
#
# An engine revert likely meant the author had to stop the next task they were
# working on and fix the issue in the engine before letting it roll again.
rollRevert: 24.0 # SWE hours lost to a single engine revert
